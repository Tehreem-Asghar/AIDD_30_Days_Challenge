The email validation function should accept a string representing an email address and determine its validity based on a set of criteria. Specifically, the function must ensure the email address contains a single "@" symbol separating the local part from the domain, and that the domain includes a top-level domain (e.g., ".com", ".org") following a valid domain name. Upon validation, the function should return a boolean indicating whether the email is valid, and if invalid, it must provide clear and specific error messages detailing which validation rule was not met.
